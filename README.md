# 🎯 Number Guessing Game

A simple Python-based number guessing game that challenges the user to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. Built with recursion and basic input validation, this project is great for beginners learning Python fundamentals.

## 🚀 How It Works

- The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- The user is prompted to guess the number.
- If the guess is incorrect, the game continues using a loop until the correct number is guessed.
- The user is given clues by advising to guess higher or lower.
- Input validation ensures only numeric guesses are accepted.

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- `random` module
- while loop with nested conditional statements
- Input validation
- Conditional logic
